# Cpp-SFML-Bonger-Ball-Game
‘Bonger Ball’ is a ‘reto-stylize’ game based on the classic 1976 ‘Breakout’ video game written in C++ and utilizing the SFML library.  This game builds on Mr. John Horton’s ‘Pong’ game featured in his book, ‘Beginning C++ Game Programing’, and published by Packt>.  ‘Bonger Ball’ takes Mr. Horton’s ‘Pong” as a starting point, and adds classes and features (sound, graphics, etc.) to this game.

RULES/GOAL:

The goal of 'Bonger Ball' is to receive the highest score possible by destroying bricks and conquering levels.  Bricks are destroyed upon contact with the ball.  Every brick destroyed is worth Points!   When all the bricks are destroyed, the level is conquered.  The player will then move on to the next level.  Each new level becomes more challenging than the last as the ball moves faster.

A destroyed brick is worth 10 points on the first level.  The value of each brick will increase by 5 points per level.  Thus, bricks on Level 2 are worth 15 points each; on level 3, they are worth 20 points; on level 4, they are 25 points and so forth.
